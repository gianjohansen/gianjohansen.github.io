A landing page for a third-party partnership was underperforming and we were given the challenge of rebuilding it.

                    <p class="description">Over the three weeks we worked on the page we released over fifteen rapid-fire experiments. We ended up moving the conversion rate from its starting point of 0.78% to a high of <strong>5.60%</strong>, and so we wound down the project with a week to spare.</p>

                        <p><em>"This group made the impossible possible. They took on the challenge of increasing conversions from the On The House landing page 5x in 3 weeks. It's been great to watch the team iterate super-fast on the concepts and stay focused. They were able to hit their goal of a 5% conversion rate by the start of January, which has put us in really good stead to hit our OKR this quarter."</em></p>

                    <h2>Process</h2>

                    <p>The initial build for the partnership was completed in October but had significantly underperformed relative to our usual lead conversion. To address this we put together a mini-scrum team of myself, a product manager to own the change and a designer for the interface work.</p>

                    <p><strong>The Starting Point</strong></p>

                    <p>Feedback for the previous design (built 2 months before we started) mostly centered around it being too complicated and too unclear in its messaging:</p>

                    <img src="/assets/img/case-study/oa-1.png">

                    <p><strong>The Constraints</strong></p>

                    <p>We had significant constraints on the project:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;with our limited thirty day deadline we needed to keep development times low</li>
                        <li>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;the page wasn't receiving enough traffic to effectively run A/B split tests</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>This meant we didn't have our familiar A/B testing strategy to rely on. Normally we'd count a conversion change from 2.0% to 2.1% as a big win, but here we had a month to deliver on a 6x conversion increase. A 0.1% improvement at each iteration just wouldn't cut it. We decided instead on a much riskier approach.</p>

                    <p><strong>The Approach</strong></p>

                    <p>Instead of small, iterative tests we would instead trial significant changes in each release, with a rapid release cadence. We would collect just enough data to know whether there had been a step improvement in conversions, then move on. We'd test everything, from updated messaging to better user experience, with a new hypothesis every few days and small interface tweaks in between. We would test a different hypothesis at each big release and improve UX on the days we were collecting and analysing the data. This gave us both high risk, high reward releases and safer, incremental releases.</p>

                    <p><strong>The Experiments</strong></p>

                    <p>Our initial experiments focused on an overhaul of the user experience. From past projects we knew that a multi-step conversion process converted better for us than a simple single-page form, and in the past we'd built a basic experience we could swap in with minimal changes. We figured this would help the journey look less intimidating.</p>

                    <img src="/assets/img/case-study/oa-2.png">

                    <p>This would also require a new landing page to lead in to this form, and we were again able to reuse a past experiment with only small changes to wording and assets.</p>

                    <img src="/assets/img/case-study/oa-3.png">

                    <p>This was a big win over the course of several experiments, giving us an improvement on conversion rates from 0.78% to 2.27%.</p>

                    <p>Next our focus was on value proposition. The page wasn't clear on what the user would receive after conversion, and our hypothesis was that this was scaring users off. We rebuilt the landing page with stronger explanations of the service that the company provides and more emphasis on the distinct branding of the two companies.</p>

                    <img src="/assets/img/case-study/oa-4.png">

                    <p>This also resulted in an improved conversion rate, although not as strong as we'd hoped. We moved from 2.27% to 3.08%.</p>

                    <p>We decided to test a second value proposition. Both companies had a reputation for being data-driven and we wanted to leverage that in our messaging. We rebuilt again, with our new modules shifting the focus from the service angle to data instead.</p>

                    <img src="/assets/img/case-study/oa-5.png">

                    <p>This messaging was a clear winner, most likely because the users finding the page were interested in data and so would have much preferred this value proposition, although not as strongly as we'd hoped. Over that weekend we'd moved from 3.08% to 3.61%.</p>

                    <p>The final stage of our experimentation was again UX, with us speeding up the conversion funnel pages behind the landing page. We linked it to the landing page by adding interesting data points to the start of the experience, and removing animations meant we more than halved the time it took for users to complete the journey.</p>

                    <img src="/assets/img/case-study/oa-6.png">

                    <p>With this last test the entire experience was sitting on a 5.6% conversion rate, which the company was more than happy with. We scaled up the traffic sent to the page, made small design tweaks to tighten up the edges and then moved on. That page now accounts for approximately 10% of all of the company's leads.</p>
